# Assignment — Team 3, Task 1: Streamed response rendering, one prompt to one cited answer

**Seam:** oracle · **Team:** 3 · **Task:** 1 of ~10
**Area(s):** Oracle · **Verb served:** question

## 1. Curriculum map

This task exercises asynchronous state and side effects on top of the framework island pattern from [Unit 3 — Astro advanced](https://ruvebal.github.io/web-atelier-udit/lessons/en/feii/unit-3-astro-advanced/) (multi-framework islands, data fetching), and its test shape follows [Unit 5 — Testing strategy](https://ruvebal.github.io/web-atelier-udit/lessons/en/feii/unit-5-testing-strategy/).

*Note: no standalone "streaming UI" unit exists yet in the FE II track — there is no Unit titled "React State & Effects"; a prior draft of this brief invented one, with a dead link. This relies on Unit 3's general data-fetching and island-hydration principles instead.*

## 2. Worked example, from the real TTOD app

The instructor-provided hello-world implementation in `services/frontend/src/components/oracle/` already demonstrates the target behavior. Specifically, `OracleTerminal.tsx` consumes the `readOracleStream` helper from the colocated `sse.ts` to handle the Server-Sent Events (SSE) connection.

*   **Real File:** `services/frontend/src/components/oracle/ASSIGNMENT.md` (module brief) and `OracleTerminal.tsx` (implementation)
*   **Real Function:** `readOracleStream` (from `services/frontend/src/components/oracle/sse.ts`)
*   **Real Behavior:** The current implementation sends a single prompt, receives a stream of `OracleResponseChunk` objects, and renders them sequentially. It already handles the `grounded` vs `creative` distinction in the payload and includes a busy/double-submit guard. This task requires you to understand, harden, and document this existing baseline, not build it from scratch.

## 3. What "done" looks like

**Visible result:**
A user submits a single prompt in the Oracle terminal. The response appears incrementally as chunks arrive, without waiting for the full response to buffer.

*Out of scope for this task, owned elsewhere on the board: live-region/screen-reader announcement of the streaming text is Task 2's deliverable, and the grounded/creative mode label plus navigable `citedQuoteIds` links are Task 3's deliverable. This task's own accessibility surface is the reduced-motion and busy-guard behavior below — do not re-implement or re-grade Task 2/3's work here.*

**What it includes:**
*   **Streaming State Management:** React state is updated as each SSE chunk arrives, without buffering the whole answer before first paint.
*   **Reduced Motion:** The streaming animation respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
*   **Busy Guard:** The submit button is disabled or shows a loading state while the stream is active to prevent double-submission.

**What has to be done:**
1.  **Verify Existing Implementation:** Confirm that the current hello-world code uses `readOracleStream` and `parseSseEvent` from `sse.ts` unmodified.
2.  **Harden State Logic:** Ensure that React state updates are batched correctly to avoid layout thrashing during high-frequency chunk arrivals.
3.  **Reduced-Motion Audit:** Verify that the streaming animation itself (not the live-region announcement — that is Task 2) is disabled for users with reduced-motion preferences.
4.  **Document the Baseline:** Write a brief note in the module's `ASSIGNMENT.md` or a local `README` explaining how the streaming state is managed, citing the specific helper functions used.
5.  **Test the Guard:** Manually verify that submitting a second prompt while the first is streaming is prevented or queued (per the module's constraints, it should be prevented/guarded).

*Note: `docs/public/teaching/tasks.md` does not contain existing prose for this specific item (Board Item 1). The above is grounded entirely in the module’s `ASSIGNMENT.md` hello-world description.*

## 4. Success criteria (functional)

*   **Streaming Integrity:** The response is rendered incrementally as chunks arrive; the entire answer is not buffered before first paint.
*   **Busy Guard:** A double-submit guard prevents multiple concurrent streams from the same terminal instance.
*   **Reduced Motion:** The streaming animation is disabled when `prefers-reduced-motion` is set to `reduce`.

## 5. Quality criteria (the part that's new)

*   **Code Organization:** The streaming logic is encapsulated within the component or a custom hook, keeping the render function clean. No new SSE parsers are invented; the existing `sse.ts` helpers are used.
*   **AI-Use/Process Documentation:** A brief comment or docstring in the code explains *why* the state is updated on each chunk rather than batching, referencing the "no buffering before first paint" constraint.
*   **Test Shape:** Per R7's Trophy-not-Pyramid doctrine, include at least one integration test that mocks the SSE stream and verifies that the UI updates incrementally, and that the busy guard correctly blocks a second submission mid-stream. Do not write unit tests for the `sse.ts` parser (it is frozen); test the *consumption* of the stream. (The live region itself is Task 2's own test surface, not this task's.)
*   **Accessibility:** The component inherits the global Definition of Done: keyboard-operable, one accessible name or label, no meaning carried by color alone, respects reduced-motion preferences. Cite this global standard rather than restating it as unique to this task.
*   **Oral Defense:** Be prepared to explain how you ensured React's batching behavior doesn't introduce a delay between a chunk arriving and it appearing on screen, and how the busy guard prevents a second submission from corrupting the in-flight stream's state.

This quote reminds us that while the Oracle’s streaming response is fluent and immediate, our job is to ensure the *context* (the architecture of the stream, the conventions of accessibility) is fed to the user correctly, so the interaction feels like a partnership rather than a black box.
