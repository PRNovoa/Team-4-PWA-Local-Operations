# Assignment — Team 2, Task 2: One accessible node selection reflected as text, not just a visual highlight

**Seam:** graph · **Team:** 2 · **Task:** 2 of ~10
**Area(s):** Graph · **Verb served:** question

## 1. Curriculum map

This task exercises SVG accessibility and state-driven UI on top of the same Svelte island covered in [Unit 2](https://ruvebal.github.io/web-atelier-udit/lessons/en/feii/unit-2-astro-fundamentals/) and [Unit 3](https://ruvebal.github.io/web-atelier-udit/lessons/en/feii/unit-3-astro-advanced/) — no standalone "accessible SVG selection" unit exists yet in the FE II track, so this applies the accessibility standards from the module's own Definition of Done directly: interactive elements must be operable via keyboard and screen readers.

## 2. Worked example, from the real TTOD app

The hello-world implementation on the `ts5` assembly worktree already contains the foundational pattern for this task. In `services/frontend/src/pages/[locale]/wisdom/GraphIsland.svelte` (or the equivalent graph island component), the code currently implements:

1.  **Focusable Nodes:** Each SVG `<circle>` or `<g>` element representing a node has `role="button"`, `tabindex="0"`, and a descriptive `aria-label`.
2.  **Keyboard Events:** Event listeners for `keydown` handle `Enter` and `Space` to trigger selection, mirroring the `click` event.
3.  **Text Reflection:** Upon selection, the component updates a reactive state variable (e.g., `selectedNode`) which drives the content of an `<aside>` element. This `<aside>` displays the node's `text` property, ensuring the selection is reflected as readable text, not just a visual highlight (e.g., a stroke change).

This existing pattern is the baseline. The task is to **confirm, harden, and extend** this pattern to ensure it remains robust as the graph grows and as other features (like filtering) are added.

## 3. What "done" looks like

*Note: No existing prose for this specific item exists in `docs/public/teaching/tasks.md`. The following is grounded in the module's `ASSIGNMENT.md` and the current hello-world state.*

**Visible result:**
When a user selects a node via mouse click or keyboard (Tab to focus, Enter/Space to select), the node’s associated text content is immediately displayed in a clearly labeled, accessible `<aside>` panel adjacent to the graph. The visual highlight (e.g., stroke color, size) is secondary to the textual feedback.

**What it includes:**
1.  **Preserved Accessibility Attributes:** Every node retains `role="button"`, `tabindex`, and a unique, descriptive `aria-label` (e.g., "Node: [Name], Tag: [Tag]").
2.  **Keyboard Parity:** Selection is fully operable via keyboard. Focus management is sensible; selecting a node does not trap focus, and the `<aside>` content is announced by screen readers (using `aria-live="polite"` or equivalent on the text container).
3.  **No Color-Only Meaning:** The selection state is not conveyed solely by color. The textual reflection in the `<aside>` is the primary indicator of "selected" state.
4.  **Reduced Motion Respect:** Any visual transitions associated with selection (e.g., stroke animation) respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
5.  **Integration Readiness:** The selection state is reactive (Svelte `$state`/`$derived`) and ready to be consumed by future tasks (e.g., URL state, filtering) without breaking the accessibility contract.

**What has to be done:**
1.  **Audit Existing Code:** Review `GraphIsland.svelte` to verify that `aria-label` is dynamic and descriptive (not just "Node 1").
2.  **Harden Keyboard Handling:** Ensure `keydown` listeners correctly prevent default scrolling on `Space` and trigger selection on `Enter`/`Space`. Verify that `blur` or `focusout` does not inadvertently clear the selection if the user moves focus to the `<aside>`.
3.  **Enhance Text Reflection:** Ensure the `<aside>` has a clear heading (e.g., "Selected Node") and that the text content updates reactively. Add `aria-live="polite"` to the text container so screen readers announce changes.
4.  **Verify Reduced Motion:** If any CSS transitions or GSAP animations are applied to the selected node, ensure they are disabled or minimized when `prefers-reduced-motion` is set.
5.  **Test with Screen Reader:** Manually test with a screen reader (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver) to confirm that selecting a node via keyboard announces the node name and that the `<aside>` content is read aloud.

## 4. Success criteria (functional)

1.  **Keyboard Selection Works:** Pressing `Enter` or `Space` on a focused node updates the `<aside>` text to that node’s `text` property.
2.  **Click Selection Works:** Clicking a node updates the `<aside>` text to that node’s `text` property.
3.  **Accessible Name Present:** Every node has a unique, descriptive `aria-label` that includes the node’s name and, if available, its tag.
4.  **Screen Reader Announcement:** Changes to the `<aside>` text are announced by screen readers (verified via `aria-live` or equivalent).
5.  **No Focus Trap:** After selecting a node, focus remains on the node or moves to a logical next element (e.g., the `<aside>` heading) without trapping the user.
6.  **Reduced Motion Compliance:** Visual selection effects (e.g., stroke animation) are disabled or reduced when `prefers-reduced-motion` is enabled.

## 5. Quality criteria (the part that's new)

*   **Code Organization:** The selection logic is encapsulated in the `GraphIsland.svelte` component. The `<aside>` is a separate, accessible component or clearly marked section. No global state pollution; selection is local to the island.
*   **AI-Use/Process Documentation:** Any AI-assisted code generation for accessibility attributes (e.g., `aria-label` templates) is documented in the PR description, explaining *why* specific attributes were chosen.
*   **Test Shape:** Per R7’s Trophy-not-Pyramid doctrine, tests should focus on **behavioral outcomes** (e.g., "selecting a node updates the aside text") rather than implementation details (e.g., "clicking a circle triggers a function"). Use testing libraries that simulate user interaction (e.g., `@testing-library/svelte`) to verify accessibility attributes and text updates.
*   **Accessibility:** This task inherits the global Definition of Done: keyboard-operable, one accessible name or label, no meaning carried by color alone, respects reduced-motion preferences. This is not a task-specific requirement but a baseline for all TTOD work.
*   **Defensible Oral-Defense Answer:** "I ensured that node selection is not just a visual highlight but a semantic event. By using `aria-live` on the text reflection and maintaining keyboard parity, I made the graph accessible to users who rely on screen readers or keyboard navigation. This aligns with the principle that accessibility is a foundation, not a feature."

## Closing

> "Accessibility is not a feature. It is the foundation upon which all features rest."
> — TTOD `a11y-001`, *accessibility*

This task embodies that principle by ensuring that the core interaction of node selection is accessible from the start, not bolted on later.
