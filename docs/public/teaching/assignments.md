# What you build, for whom, and why

The [teaching model]({{ '/teaching/' | relative_url }}) page says how the six areas map to course
units. This page says why each one matters and what "done" looks like — a backlog in product
terms, not just an engineering task list.

## Who TTOD serves

| Persona | What they want |
| --- | --- |
| Visitor | Find a fragment of wisdom relevant to a moment, with no friction and no signup |
| Registered reader | Keep a personal library of quotes worth returning to |
| Contributor | Add a quote they believe belongs in the corpus |
| Reviewer | Judge proposals with the same tools already trusted for code review |
| External developer | Build something on top of TTOD's data without scraping HTML |

There is no separate "accessibility persona." Every story below inherits the same accessibility
commitment regardless of which persona it serves — see [Why accessibility is a
commitment](#why-accessibility-is-a-commitment-not-a-checklist).

## Four verbs

Every assignment in this backlog is one of four verbs, done for one persona: **find**, **keep**,
**question**, **contribute**. If a feature doesn't serve one of those four for a named persona, it
doesn't belong on the backlog.

## User journeys

**A visitor finds a quote that fits their moment.** Lands on the homepage → browses by section,
tag, or level → opens the knowledge graph and follows a connection → asks the Oracle a real
question → reads a quote-grounded answer → notices the invitation to log in and save it.

**A registered reader builds a personal library.** Logs in → returns to a quote page → saves it →
comes back later, opens their library → removes one that no longer fits.

**A contributor proposes a new quote.** Logs in → opens the propose form → submits a quote with
its source → the system opens a review request → a human reviewer reads it and may ask for
changes → the contributor revises → the quote goes live, credited to them. The wait for review is
deliberate, not friction to remove — only a named human ever accepts a quote into the governed
collection.

**A reviewer processes a proposal.** Sees the request in the normal review queue → reads the
proposed quote and its source → comments, requests changes, or approves → approval computes the
exact change to the governed collection → a second look at that specific change is what actually
publishes it. Two touchpoints, not one — approving the idea and approving the exact diff are kept
separate on purpose.

**An external developer integrates the public API.** Reads the API documentation → creates an
account, logs in → requests an access token → calls the API with it → gets back a quote.

## The backlog, by area

Every story below carries the same Definition of Done: keyboard-operable, one accessible name or
label, no meaning carried by color alone, respects reduced-motion preferences. That isn't repeated
per item — it's not optional for any of them.

**Browse & discover** — a visitor can browse by section, tag, or level in their language; every
quote page shows its source and context; breadcrumbs lead back to where you came from.

**Explore relationships** — a visitor can see how quotes relate to each other in a graph; a
keyboard or screen-reader user gets every graph selection reflected as accessible text, not just a
visual highlight.

**Ask the Oracle** — a visitor can ask a real question and get a quote-grounded answer, streamed
in as it's generated; a screen-reader user gets that streaming answer announced as it arrives, not
silence until it's done; a cold-started deployment shows a "preparing" state instead of hanging
quietly.

**Take it offline** — previously seen content keeps working without a connection; the app can be
installed like a native one.

**Make it mine** — a visitor can create an account and log in; a registered reader can save and
remove quotes from a personal library.

**Contribute wisdom** — a registered reader can propose a new quote; a contributor can see their
proposal's status; a reviewer can review proposals with the same tools already used for code;
only a named human's approval ever writes the governed collection — no automation, AI included,
ever does that silently.

**Build on TTOD** — an external developer gets a documented, token-authenticated API and a small
working example client, proof the API works outside the browser, not just inside this app's own
UI.

## Team task board

Eight students, five teams — three pairs on the richest, most contract-heavy areas; two solos on
the two most bounded ones. Every team's list below runs ~10 tasks, tagged by which of the six
areas each one actually touches: your own area is depth, the others are the breadth this course
explicitly grades (see [Why accessibility is a commitment](#why-accessibility-is-a-commitment-not-a-checklist)
for why the testing/accessibility tag applies to every row, every team, not just one).

**This is the overview.** For what each task's visible result looks for, what it includes, and
what actually has to be done — grounded in that task's own brief in the dev plan, not a generic
restatement, and linked back to its GitHub source — see [task details]({{ '/teaching/tasks/' | relative_url }}).

**Lessons for these tasks.** The FE II track at web-atelier-udit teaches the Astro architecture
every team builds on. All seven Unit 1–7 lessons are published — link text below names exactly
which tasks each one grounds, not just "read this at some point":

- [Unit 1 — Kickoff](https://ruvebal.github.io/web-atelier-udit/lessons/en/feii/unit-1-kickoff/) — orientation for every team, before task 1
- [Unit 2 — Astro fundamentals](https://ruvebal.github.io/web-atelier-udit/lessons/en/feii/unit-2-astro-fundamentals/) — routing, layouts, and a first framework island; prerequisite for Team 1's, Team 2's, and Team 3's task 1
- [Unit 3 — Astro advanced](https://ruvebal.github.io/web-atelier-udit/lessons/en/feii/unit-3-astro-advanced/) — content collections, i18n routing, data fetching, and multi-framework islands, worked entirely through TTOD's own source code; prerequisite for Team 1's tasks 1 and 6, and for Team 2's and Team 3's task 1
- [Unit 4 — Progressive Web Apps & Offline Capabilities](https://ruvebal.github.io/web-atelier-udit/lessons/en/feii/unit-4-pwa-offline/) — service-worker lifecycle, caching strategy, install quality; Team 4's own tasks 1, 3, and 5 draw directly on this unit
- [Unit 5 — Testing strategy](https://ruvebal.github.io/web-atelier-udit/lessons/en/feii/unit-5-testing-strategy/) — the Testing Trophy doctrine every team's own task 7 (task 6 for Teams 1 and 4) draws on; see the [dev sprint timeline]({{ '/teaching/timeline/' | relative_url }}) for when each team's testing task lands
- [Unit 6 — AI-Assisted Code Review](https://ruvebal.github.io/web-atelier-udit/lessons/en/feii/unit-6-ai-code-review/) — human-in-the-loop review discipline behind every task's AI-disclosure requirement (§5 of [the assignment template]({{ '/teaching/tasks/' | relative_url }})) and the hackathon week's own PR-review checkpoint
- [Unit 7 — Performance](https://ruvebal.github.io/web-atelier-udit/lessons/en/feii/unit-7-performance/) — measured Core Web Vitals work; the session that follows the [dev sprint]({{ '/teaching/timeline/' | relative_url }}), once all six areas actually run

**On headcount:** this board uses the confirmed 8-student, five-team split
(2+1+2+1+2 — three pairs on the richest areas, two solos on the most bounded ones). If your actual
roster is seven, keep the module boundaries fixed and fold one pair down to a trio rather than
dropping a module — the six areas and the ten-task shape per team don't need to change, just who's
on which team.

## Why accessibility is a commitment, not a checklist

An aphorism is offered as wisdom that holds regardless of who is reading it, when, or how. A
product built on that claim cannot then quietly narrow who is able to receive it based on how they
perceive a screen — that would contradict the content's own premise, not just create a UX gap.

This resolves into three commitments carried through every story above: **content parity** — no
meaning exists in only one channel, so a graph selection is always readable as text and a
streaming answer is always announced, not just rendered; **process, not a gate** — accessibility
checks run on every change, not as a scramble before submission; **a whole-product baseline** —
every story inherits the same Definition of Done, not just the areas that feel visually
interactive.
